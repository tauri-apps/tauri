# Gatsby Themed Site
This is a minimal config required gatsby site created using themes. The intention is to smoke test gatsby and provide an assortment of pages to test tauri response.

This _does_ use an API key to Airtable, but we have made it optional. (Although currently gatsby is rather aggressive in compiling things out of node_modules so `gatsby-config.js` has a hack to rename files so gatsby will ignore them. [insert heavy sigh here])
