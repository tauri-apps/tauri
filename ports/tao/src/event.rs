//! The `Event` enum and assorted supporting types.
//!
//! These are sent to the closure given to [`EventLoop::run(...)`][event_loop_run], where they get
//! processed and used to modify the program state. For more details, see the root-level documentation.
//!
//! Some of these events represent different "parts" of a traditional event-handling loop. You could
//! approximate the basic ordering loop of [`EventLoop::run(...)`][event_loop_run] like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let mut control_flow = ControlFlow::Poll;
//! let mut start_cause = StartCause::Init;
//!
//! while control_flow != ControlFlow::Exit {
//!     event_handler(NewEvents(start_cause), ..., &mut control_flow);
//!
//!     for e in (window events, user events, device events) {
//!         event_handler(e, ..., &mut control_flow);
//!     }
//!     event_handler(MainEventsCleared, ..., &mut control_flow);
//!
//!     for w in (redraw windows) {
//!         event_handler(RedrawRequested(w), ..., &mut control_flow);
//!     }
//!     event_handler(RedrawEventsCleared, ..., &mut control_flow);
//!
//!     start_cause = wait_if_necessary(control_flow);
//! }
//!
//! event_handler(LoopDestroyed, ..., &mut control_flow);
//! ```
//!
//! This leaves out timing details like `ControlFlow::WaitUntil` but hopefully
//! describes what happens in what order.
